The "Possibility Space" Puzzle

Humans love making systems with *alien* properties.  A pottery wheel that can make inhumanly perfect vessels, shells that we can stamp into inhumanly perfect repetitions, cards and dice that lift our choices from our hands into the hands of the fate.

With each system, we shrink the space from "anything we can make" into "anything the system can make", with a willing trade of some part of our human agency for some gift of beautifully alien possibilities.

When we find ourselves in these realms of alien possibilities, how do we navigate? The faerie worlds we visit will be strange... Vast seas filled with things that once seemed precious and rare, now churning and flowing in undifferentiated waves.  Perhaps things that once seemed small, common, and rustic now seem precious - a handmade wooden cup in a wall of perfect golden treasures.  

What is it to make art in this realm?  Can you make a collage out of the vastness? Build pathways and gardens out of the infinite? Name - and love - each treasure in the sea?

The goal of this workshop is to discover (remember) the ways that we have made our homes and stories in alien possibility spaces before.  From tarot, to mathematics, to business, to generative music and planets, to friendship bracelet kits, to cutup poetry, to karaoke covers, to chatbots - we will pull patterns and games to reuse and rebuild.  We can end the weekend with zines, rituals, games, documentaries, papers, companies, plans, and anything we can use to bring back the knowledge that we find together.  

You have each been chosen because you possess **several really interesting pieces** of this puzzle. 

In a time when we face inhuman uses of technology, we will find an answer (a space of answers) to "how do we make human meaning out of inhuman spaces?" And bring it back to where it will be of most use.
