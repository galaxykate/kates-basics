# Recordings

Goals: 
Given some complicated world, we want to be able to 
- record data from world state 
- playback data onto a new but compatible world state
- extract a "frame"



# Particles
Should the edges be linked to 

Updatable voronoi:
recalculate the voronoi
identify which edges have appeared or disappeard
update other edges
ditto regions

edges are defined by the two sites, 
regions are defined by a single site

A system is when you share UI 
count, create new, force sliders, etc


# Timeseries

checklist
record multiple streams as one fusion file
playback the file on whatever is available
